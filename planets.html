<h1> PLANETS </h1>
<p>
    <b> A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant.</b> 
    <br><br>
    <strong> The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. </strong>
 <br><br>
    <i> Planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity, a process called accretion. </i>
     <br><br>
     <em> The Solar System has at least eight planets: the terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, and the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. </em> 
      <br><br>
     <u>  These planets each rotate around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole. </u>
       <br><br>
       <s>  All planets of the Solar System </s>  other than <del> Mercury  </del> <ins> the first planet in the solar syatem </ins> possess a considerable atmosphere, and some share such features as ice caps, seasons, volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology. 
         <br><br>
         Apart from <sub> Venus and Mars </sub> , the Solar System planets generate <sup> magnetic fields </sup> , and all except Venus and Mercury have natural satellites. 
          <br><br>
          <tt> The giant planets bear planetary rings, the most prominent being those of Saturn.</tt>
